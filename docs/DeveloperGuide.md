## **Software Overview**
EduMate is a desktop app designed for NUS students to manage their academic and social lives. It is optimized for use through a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still providing the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you type quickly, eduMate can complete contact and module management tasks faster than traditional GUI apps.

---

## **Intended Audience**
This guide is intended primarily for developers who want to work on the **EduMate** Software code base at [https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: To get started, you'll want to set up your [Development Environment](#2-development-environment) and make sure you understand the branching strategy described in the [Version Control](#version-control) section and how to make a pull request. Thorough [testing](#5-testing) is expected for all pull requests, such that all testable methods are amply tested.

## **Version Control**
### **The `master` Branch**

The `master` branch represents stable released versions of the **EduMate** software. It is expected that this version always works as expected.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">

:warning::warning: You must not merge a PR into the branch if it fails some tests.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">

:heavy_check_mark: Instead, you should fork from this master branch into your own repo and work on new features on a branch off your own repo. Your `master` branch should always be synced with the upstream `master` branch.

</div>

### **How to Make a Pull Request**

Once you've made changes to your branch, create a Pull Request (PR) on the upstream `master` branch and link the PR with any relevant issues and milestones.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">

:warning::warning: You must not review and merge your own PR. Instead, wait for somebody else to review it for you. In this way, we can cross-check each others' code, leading to fewer errors.

</div>

## **Sample Data**

Sample data for **EduMate** can be found [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/sampleData.txt). It is a set of 100 persons with procedurally-generated fields.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: Each row represents a person's information, with the `|` separating the different fields.

In order, they are: `name|phone|email|address|telegram|groups|modules`. Note that groups and modules are separated by a space.

</div>

For example, `Bee Shan|81121128|beeshan@gmail.com|200 Bishan Road|@beeshan|NS CCA|CS3242 BT3101 CS1010E CS3219 CE3165` provides information for a person with the following details:

| Field           | Value                                   |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Name            | Bee Shan                                |
| Phone           | 81121128                                |
| Email           | beeshan@gmail.com                       |
 | Address         | 200 Bishan Road                         |
 | Telegram Handle | @beeshan                                |
 | Groups          | NS, CCA                                 |
 | Modules         | CS3242, BT3101, CS1010E, CS3219, CE3165 |

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: These names were chosen so that we can easily extract more information such as Location (as coordinates) for use in future features.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:warning: Try not to alter this data too much, as some persons (like Albert Park) are used in testing.

# **4. Design**

## **Architecture**

|    <img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" style="width:40%; margin:0 25%">     |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| _Figure 4.1.1_ *Architecture Diagram* explaining the high-level design of the App |

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

### **Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


### **How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.


| <img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" style="width:90vw"> |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|     _Figure 4.1.2_ *Sequence Diagram* for the command `delete 1`      |

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

| <img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" style="width:40%; margin: 0 25%"> |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|           _Figure 4.1.3_ *Class Diagram* for Component Managers           |

The sections below give more details of each component.

---

## **UI Component**

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

| <img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" style="width:90vw">  |
|:---------------------------------------------------------:|
|     _Figure 4.2.1_ *Class Diagram* for UI Components      |

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

## **Model Component**

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

| <img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" style="width:90vw"> |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------:|
|     _Figure 4.3.1_ *Class Diagram* for Model Components     |

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

## **Logic Component**

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

| <img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" style="width:90vw"> |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------:|
|     _Figure 4.4.1_ *Class Diagram* for Logic Components     |

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `EduMateParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

### **Commands**
#### **Add Command**

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("add n/Bart...")` API call.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

#### **Edit Command**

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("edit 1...")` API call.

#### **Delete Command**

### **Parsers**

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

| <img src="images/ParserClasses.png" style="width:90vw"> |
|:-------------------------------------------------------:|
|  _Figure 4.4.x_ *Class Diagram* for Parser Components   |

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `EduMateParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `EduMateParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

## **Storage Component**

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

| <img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" style="width:90vw"> |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------:|
|     _Figure 4.5.1_ *Class Diagram* for Storage Components     |

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `EduMateStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

## **Project Requirements**

### **Product Scope**

#### **Target user profile**

* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* is an NUS student

#### **Value proposition**

Help NUS students maintain both their social and academic life by lowering the barriers to meet up and make new friends within modules.

### **User Stories**

Priorities: High (must have) - `***`, Medium (nice to have) - `**`, Low (unlikely to have) - `*`

| Priority | As a …​   | I want to …​                                           | So that I can…​                              |
|----------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `***`    | student   | view all my modules in one place                       | be more organised in my work                 |
| `***`    | user      | use this app quickly with the command line             | quickly plan my modules                      |

| `***`    | user      | update my profile                                      | personalise my experience                    |
| `***`    | user      | add module tags to new contacts                        | track what modules my friends are taking     |
| `***`    | user      | tag and untag modules from existing contacts           | be flexible in recording my friends' modules |
| `***`    | user      | filter my contacts based on module tag                 | find friends taking the same module as me    |
| `**`     | user      | sort my contacts based on the number of shared modules | find out who are likely my close friends     |

### **Launch and shutdown**

1. Initial launch

    * 1a. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

    * 1b. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

2. Saving window preferences

    * 2a. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

    * 2b. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
      Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### **Deleting a person**

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

    * 1a. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.

    * 1b. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

    * 1c. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

    * 1d. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.


### **Saving data**

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files
