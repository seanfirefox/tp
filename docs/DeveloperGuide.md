# **1. Introduction**

---

## **Software Overview**
EduMate is a desktop app designed for NUS students to manage their academic and social lives. It is optimized for use through a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still providing the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you type quickly, eduMate can complete contact and module management tasks faster than traditional GUI apps.

---

## **Intended Audience**
This guide is intended primarily for developers who want to work on the **EduMate** Software code base at [https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: To get started, you'll want to set up your [Development Environment](#2-development-environment) and make sure you understand the branching strategy described in the [Version Control](#version-control) section and how to make a pull request. Thorough [testing](#5-testing) is expected for all pull requests, such that all testable methods are amply tested.

## **Version Control**
### **The `master` Branch**

The `master` branch represents stable released versions of the **EduMate** software. It is expected that this version always works as expected.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">

:warning::warning: You must not merge a PR into the branch if it fails some tests.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">

:heavy_check_mark: Instead, you should fork from this master branch into your own repo and work on new features on a branch off your own repo. Your `master` branch should always be synced with the upstream `master` branch.

</div>

### **How to Make a Pull Request**

Once you've made changes to your branch, create a Pull Request (PR) on the upstream `master` branch and link the PR with any relevant issues and milestones.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">

:warning::warning: You must not review and merge your own PR. Instead, wait for somebody else to review it for you. In this way, we can cross-check each others' code, leading to fewer errors.

</div>

## **Sample Data**

Sample data for **EduMate** can be found [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/sampleData.txt). It is a set of 100 persons with procedurally-generated fields.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: Each row represents a person's information, with the `|` separating the different fields.

In order, they are: `name|phone|email|address|telegram|groups|modules`. Note that groups and modules are separated by a space.

</div>

For example, `Bee Shan|81121128|beeshan@gmail.com|200 Bishan Road|@beeshan|NS CCA|CS3242 BT3101 CS1010E CS3219 CE3165` provides information for a person with the following details:

| Field           | Value                                   |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Name            | Bee Shan                                |
| Phone           | 81121128                                |
| Email           | beeshan@gmail.com                       |
 | Address         | 200 Bishan Road                         |
 | Telegram Handle | @beeshan                                |
 | Groups          | NS, CCA                                 |
 | Modules         | CS3242, BT3101, CS1010E, CS3219, CE3165 |

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: These names were chosen so that we can easily extract more information such as Location (as coordinates) for use in future features.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:warning: Try not to alter this data too much, as some persons (like Albert Park) are used in testing.

# **4. Design**

## **Architecture**

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" style="width:60%;margin:0 20%">
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 4.1.1</b> Architecture Diagram for the high-level design of the App
</div>
<br>

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

### **Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


### **How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" style="width:80%;margin:0 10%">
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 4.1.2</b> Sequence Diagram for the command <code>delete 1</code>
</div>
<br>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" style="width:70%;margin:0 15%">
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 4.1.3</b> Class Diagram for Component Managers
</div>
<br>

The sections below give more details of each component.

---

## **UI Component**

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" style="width:80%;margin:0 10%">
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 4.2.1</b> Class Diagram for UI Components
</div>
<br>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

## **Model Component**

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" style="width:80%;margin:0 10%">
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 4.3.1</b> Class Diagram for Model Components
</div>

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### **Person**

**API** : [`Person.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java)

<img src="images/PersonClassDiagram.png" style="width:80%;margin:0 10%">
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 4.3.2</b> Class Diagram for Person Components
</div>

#### **Name**
#### **Address**
#### **Phone**
#### **Email**
#### **Telegram Handle**
#### **Group Tag Set**
#### **Module Tag Set**

### **Tag**
#### **Group Tag**
#### **Module Tag**

### **Utils**
#### **Sample Data Util**

## **Logic Component**

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" style="width:80%;margin:0 10%">
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 4.4.1</b> Class Diagram for Logic Components
</div>
<br>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `EduMateParser` class to parse the user command.
2. If needed, a command-specific parser (like `AddCommandParser`) will be called to parse the arguments of the user input.
3. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
4. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
5. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

### **Commands**

#### **Add Command**

Links: [Command](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/AddCommand.java), [Parser](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddCommandParser.java)

The `add` command allows users to create a new person and insert them into the application.

**Parsing the inputs** - When the user types an input, the parser will extract out the relevant arguments and [check whether they are valid](#model-component).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Command Formats:**
* `add n/NAME p/PHONE a/ADDRESS e/EMAIL t/TELEGRAM [g/GROUP]…​ [m/MODULE]…​`

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The arguments for `AddCommand` are unordered, so the user can type them in any order. They are all handled in [Argument Multimap](#argument-multimap).

</div>

**Computing the common modules** - One of our sort keys is to use the *number of common modules* that the person has with the user. As such, we cache these modules to optimise performance.

**Assigning a Contact Index** - After the inputs have been parsed and extracted, EduMate will look to fill the *first* gap in contact index. i.e. it will find the **lowest positive integer** that isn't already the contact index of a person. Refer to the example given below:

| Current state of EduMate           | New Contact Index | Explanation                                                 |
|:-----------------------------------|:-----------------:|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Gwon Se Rang<br/>2. Lao Ming Da |         3         | 3 is the next number in the sequence.                       |
| 1. Gwon Se Rang<br/>3. Lao Ming Da |         2         | 2 is the lowest number that is not already a contact index. |

In summary, the activity diagram is as such:

<img src="images/AddActivityDiagram.png" style="width:60%;margin:0 20%">
<div style="width:60%;margin:0 20%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 4.4.2a</b> Activity Diagram for a typical <code>add</code> command
</div>

#### **Edit Command**

Links: [Command](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/EditCommand.java), [Parser](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/EditCommandParser.java)

The `edit` command allows the user to edit an existing contact in EduMate.

**Parsing the inputs** - When the user types an input, the parser will extract out the relevant arguments and [check whether they are valid](#model-component).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Command Formats:**
* `edit z/FIELD`: Edits the user details.
* `edit INDEX z/FIELD`: Edits the details of the contact at the specified `INDEX`.

</div>

**Distinguishing between contact and user** - As specified in the command formats, if the user wants to edit their own details, they can just leave out the index. On our end, the `ArgumentMultimap` has been modified to accept null as a valid index, which will handle such a use case.

:bulb: **Tip:** Similar to [`AddCommand`](#add-command), the arguments for `EditCommand` are unordered.

</div>

**Computing the common modules** - One of our sort keys is to use the *number of common modules* that the person has with the user. As such, we cache these modules to optimise performance.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Info**: When editing a contact, we only need to update the common modules for **that person**. However, when editing the user, we need to update common modules for **every person** in EduMate.

</div>

**Creating a person descriptor** - When we are editing a person, we need two things:

* The edited details: These are specified by the user as arguments in the `edit` command.
* The person's original details: If the user does not specify to edit a particular field, we take the *current* data stored in the field.

From these two sources of information, we can create a `descriptor` that keeps track of what the new person *should* be, which gives us lines such as:

* `editPersonDescriptor.getName().orElse(userToEdit.getName())`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:warning: **Warning**: If no fields have been changed, an exception is thrown. This is handled in the `EditCommandParser`.

#### **Sort Command**

Links: [Command](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/SortCommand.java), [Parser](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/SortCommandParser.java)

The `sort` command allows users to arrange their contacts in the order they desire. To be more robust in their arrangement, users are allowed to chain comparators together to break ties. For example, if the user wants to sort by groups, and break ties with name, they can simply type `sort g/ n/`.

**Parsing the inputs** - When the user types an input, the parser will *scan* through the arguments. Then, it checks whether the field needs to be sorted in **ascending** or **descending** order. Finally, it combines all the comparators together so that we get a single comparator.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Command Formats:**
* `sort`: Sorts the contacts by their index.
* `sort [z/a]…ZWSP`: Sorts the contacts by the `z` field in **ascending** order.
* `sort [z/d]…ZWSP`: Sorts the contacts by the `z` field in **descending** order.
* `sort [z/]…ZWSP`: Sorts the contacts by the `z` field in their **default** order.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** Unlike the other commands, the ordering of the arguments **does matter**. For example, `sort g/d n/a` is different from `sort n/a g/d`.

</div>

**Describing the sort** - The `Comparator` class in Java does not have a `toString()` method. As such, we have to pass a descriptor when we are creating our `SortCommand`. Additionally, we needed a mapping from the prefixes (`n/`) to their descriptors (`Name`). As such, we transformed the `Prefix` class to an `Enum` to easily get the descriptors.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:information_source: **Tips**: JavaFX works with `ObservableList` to populate the UI components. However, we can wrap this `ObservableList` inside a `SortedList` which accepts a `Comparator` as an argument. In this way, we only need to set this argument if we want to sort something in the UI.

</div>

#### **List Command**

#### **Exit Command**

{to be filled}

### **Parsers**

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" style="width:80%;margin:0 10%">
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 4.4.x</b> Class Diagram for Parser Components
</div>
<br>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `EduMateParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `EduMateParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

## **Storage Component**

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" style="width:80%;margin:0 10%">
<div style="width:80%;margin:0 10%;text-align:center">
    <b>Figure 4.5.1</b> Class Diagram for Storage Components
</div>
<br>

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `EduMateStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

## **Common Classes**

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.
