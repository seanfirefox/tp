eduMate is a **desktop app designed for NUS students to manage their academic and social lives**. It is optimized for use through a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still providing the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you type quickly, eduMate can complete contact and module management tasks faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `eduMate.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-2/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar eduMate.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

   <br>
5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `user` : View personal profile.

   * `add` : Adds a contact.

   * `tag` : Tag a module to a contact.

   * `find` : Find contacts by keywords.

   * `sort` : Sorts contact.
   
   * `view` : View contacts profile on profile window.

   <br>
6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

### Locating persons by keyowrds : `find`

Finds persons whose specified fields contain any of the given keywords.
Format: `find PREFIX/KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g hans will match Hans
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. Hans Bo will match Bo Hans
* Only the field specified by the prefix is searched. e.g. n/ means only the name field is searched
* Words matching the first part of the string will be matched e.g. Han will match Hans
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. OR search). e.g. Hans Bo will return Hans Gruber, Bo Yang

Example of usage:
* `find m/CS2103T CS2109S` returns all persons with modules CS2103T or CS2109S

Format: `sort` <br>
Example of usage: `sort` <br>
Context:
There are 4 friends with the following information:
```
Name: John Doe (User)
Modules reading: CS2103T | CS2101 | MA2104 | MA3252 | CFG1002
Name: Ben Tan
Modules reading: CS2103T | CS2101 | MA3252 | CS4230 | CS2105
Name: Jane Lane
Modules reading: CS2103T | CS2101 | CM1102 | CS2102 | CS2108
Name: John Street
Modules reading: MA3252 | MA2104 | ST2131 | MA2101S
Name: Penny Lane
Modules reading: DTK1234 | HSH1000 | HSS1000 | MA1100 | GEA1000
```
Expected outcome:
```
Name: Ben Tan
3 Common Modules: CS2103T | CS2101 | MA3252
Name: Jane Lane
2 Common Modules: CS2103T | CS2101
Name: John Street
1 Common Module: MA3252
```

Description of outcome: Assuming you have 4 friends, then there are 3 of them who are doing common modules as you, they will be sorted by decreasing number of similarity in the modules.
Hence, Ben Tan will be the first name on top as he has the most number of modules in common with the user, followed by Jane Lane and John Street with 2 and 1 common modules respectively. The 4th friend, Penny Lane, does not have any common modules with the user (John Doe) and hence is omitted.
