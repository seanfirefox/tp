# EduMate

## About the Project
* EduMate is a desktop app designed for NUS students to manage their contacts, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still reaping the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
* The project simulates an ongoing software project, for the **CS2103T Software Engineering module** offered by the National University of Singapore (NUS).
* It is named `EduMate` because it helps the user find friends and teammates for their education.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[EduMate Product Website](https://ay2223s2-cs2103t-w14-2.github.io/tp/)**.
